<!-- NODE DONE -->

## Goal

The goal of the project is to created the lightest Eclipse Distribution for Node.js development.

Of course it will include Nodeclipse plugin. See [Nodeclipse team blog](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-blog#blog)

It should not include Java Tools, but EGit, possibly JS & Web tools.

## Status 

*Under investigation*

I am trying to create our own Eclipse distribution using yoxos.

The start is simple ( just navigate to https://yoxos.eclipsesource.com/discover.html
and click "create your own custom install" )

However I have not succeeded with what to do next. The site is a bit mess. It is not clear if it is fully free.
 I will update, if I succeed.
 
### Second attempt - Googling
